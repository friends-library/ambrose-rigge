== Chapter VI

=== To Friends in the Isle of Wight.

Dear Friends,

Whom I often remember in the love of God the Father, desiring at the throne of grace,
that faith, truth and love may be daily multiplied among you,
and that you may grow in the grace of God; from him which you have received,
and in the knowledge of his Son Christ Jesus, which you have obtained,
by the light of his glorious gospel that has shined in your hearts;
so that you need not say to your neighbour, or brother, know the Lord,
but from the least of you to the greatest,
is the saving knowledge of the mysteries of his kingdom
conveyed through the light of his Son.
As you walk in the light, your knowledge will increase,
and your fellowship with the Father and the Son, and one with another,
for the gospel fellowship stands in the light;
and now he who says he has fellowship with God and walks in darkness,
lies and does not the Truth.
Therefore keep your fellowship in the light and life of Jesus, your bishop, pastor,
and lawgiver, and walk by faith in him, so will his power go along with you,
to support you through all difficulties.

Be kind-hearted one to another, and love one another,
as God for Christ`'s sake has loved you; and sit all down at the feet of Jesus,
that you may receive his wisdom and counsel, to guide you in all things,
so will you know the way of peace, which will lead you to your eternal rest.
And as God has shined in you by the light of his Son,
so let your light shine forth before men in works of righteousness,
by which saving faith is known, which works by love and obtains the victory.
The mystery of this faith is held in a pure conscience,
void of offence towards God and men; herein is your prosperity and safe standing.
And as you have received Christ, so walk in him,
all keeping your ranks and order in the body, eyeing your spiritual head,
who is given for your leader, governor and commander.

Dear Friends, meet often together, and wait at the heavenly altar;
and let your offering be a clean mind and heart, for that is the gospel offering,
and no offering without it has acceptance with God;
neither can any have access to God but by his Spirit, for it searches all things, yes,
the deep things of God; and tries all spirits that are gone out into the world,
putting a difference between the clean and unclean, the precious and the vile.
For many false prophets are abroad in the world, and have been many years, who cry,
lo here, and lo there is Christ, but go not out after them, nor believe them,
for the hope of true Christians is Christ within, Col. 1:27,
and they who are without this inward hope, they are without an anchor,
tossed like the waves of the sea with every wind of doctrine, through the sleight of men,
and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive.
Such are inwardly ravening wolves, and are everywhere known by their fruits;
but wait, that Christ may be formed in you.
This is my travail and earnest desire for you, that you may be like-minded,
having your loins girded with the Truth, waiting for the Bridegroom,
who is on his way to walk in his garden, that he has enclosed with the wall of salvation.

And now, dear Friends, I recommend you to the grace of God which is in you,
to be your continual teacher, that by it you may be saved, from the evil of this world;
and from the wrath to come.
My companion and I were in imminent danger of our lives by sea when we last left you,
going over in a little boat with a wicked pilot;
but the Lord brought us safe ashore about midnight, and gave us a calm passage,
without which we could not have continued: glory to his name forever.
And now I bid you all farewell,
hoping again to see your faces when the Lord opens my way;
to whose inward word I leave you to be guided in all things.
Amen.

Ambrose Rigge.

Rigate, this 13th day of the Sixth month, 1691.

=== An Epistle From our Monthly Meeting, Held at our Public Meeting-House in Rigate, in Surrey, the Seventh-Day of the Ninth Month, 1692.

We being assembled with one accord in the unity of the spirit of Truth,
have a deep and weighty consideration upon our hearts and spirits,
of the important affairs of the church which the Lord has gathered in these parts,
out of the ways and works of darkness, to be a people to his praise,
and to walk as children of the day, in all godly conduct, and holiness.
He who has called us is holy, and he has made us livingly sensible,
that without holiness of life and conduct none can
be true members of the church of Christ,
neither are any the sons and daughters of God,
but as they are led and guided by the Spirit of God.
All who have continued and walked in him,
have been preserved out of the pollutions of the world,
and are as lights among their neighbours, showing forth before them their good works,
of a godly peaceable and quiet life, to the praise and glory of our Heavenly Father;
for the Truth as it is in Jesus, our holy head, leader and governor,
is the life of righteousness, and frees all who receive it, from all unrighteousness.
In this are the children of God in our day manifested from the children of Belial,
for whosoever does not righteousness is not of God,
neither he who loves not his brother and neighbour; but he who walks uprightly,
walks surely, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.

And now dearly beloved Friends, whom the Lord has quickened,
and raised up out of the grave of sin and corruption to be monuments of his mercy,
walk in the light of the Lamb;
so will the salvation of God be as walls and bulwarks round about you,
to preserve you from the fear of evil.
Stand as witnesses for God in your day, against all ungodliness and worldly lusts,
both among yourselves and the world.
Be circumspect and watchful, over yourselves and your children,
and indulge them not in anything that is evil, but timely reprove and restrain it,
lest it become your sin;
and command them to observe the law of God written in their hearts;
for if you love the Truth as you ought yourselves,
you will train up your children in it when they are young.
Keep them to the plain and sound language,
which the Truth required and led all the faithful into in the beginning;
and keep them in plain and modest apparel and behaviour,
in due subjection to the Truth in all things, in a holy conduct as much as in you lies,
that they may grow up in the grace of God as plants of his renown.

This is your duty, the Lord requires it of you, even to watch over your children,
as those that must give an account to God, while they are under your wings.
Eli`'s not restraining his sons became his sin, because he restrained them not,
and brought a curse upon his house forever, 1 Sam. 3:13-14.
Therefore beware of winking at or neglecting your children`'s sins,
while under your tuition; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
lest they bring shame upon your houses, and a reproach upon your posterity,
as some have already done, by departing from the counsel of God,
and the word of his grace,
which would have kept them in the hour of temptation
from the allurements of the evil one,
and so have made themselves a scorn to fools,
and a derision to them that are round about, and opened the mouths of evil men,
to blaspheme the name of the Lord and his holy tabernacle.
Better had it been for such not to have known the way of Truth,
than thus to turn from the holy commandment,
which is the lamp of righteousness to guide our feet in the way of peace.

And all young men and maidens, unto whom God has given the knowledge of his saving Truth,
be sober and watchful, for many and strong are the assaults of the enemy to overcome you,
and to bring you back again into Egypt`'s bondage.
Stand steadfast in Him who has called you, being girded with the Truth,
that you may be able to encounter the enemy of your souls, in whichever way he appears,
having upon your heads the helmet of salvation, and the breastplate of righteousness,
and shield of faith and sound judgment, and the spiritual sword girded about your loins.
If you keep in this armour, the enemy cannot touch you.

The saving Truth which God has made known in our day, redeems all who love and obey it,
from all evil whatsoever, and out of the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity,
and sets free from every evil deed, word and work, and discovers sin in the seed,
bud and root thereof, and gives power to slay it there,
before it breaks forth into action.
For as it is inward and spiritual,
it gives an inward and spiritual sight of the man of sin
in all his wiles and temptations in the conception thereof,
and arms all who believe in it against the enemy`'s power: being greater than the enemy,
it is able to subdue his power in all mankind, and redeem them from their vain conduct,
making them capable to serve, worship and obey the living God,
which none can do while they are in the evil deeds of the world.
And neither pride, covetousness, drunkenness, gluttony, theft, murder, adultery,
idolatry, hypocrisy, nor any ungodliness whatsoever,
can have any power or prevalency over them who keep the word of faith,
which is near in their hearts.

Such are clothed with the armour of light,
and they are able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy of their souls,
and through faith in the Son of God receive victory over death, hell and the grave.
These are plants of righteousness in our day,
and are daily watered and pruned by the Father`'s right hand,
and grow up as trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
bringing forth fruits in due season to the praise of his name,
who has called them out of darkness into his marvellous light.

And now I exhort you brethren and friends, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother and sister who walks disorderly,
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but rather in the authority of God`'s power and spirit reprove them.
If any that is called a Friend or a brother, be covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one do not eat;
and if any obey not this gospel precept, note that person,
and have no fellowship with him or her, that they may be ashamed.
And if any have fellowship or society with such before they repent, after Friends,
in God`'s power and wisdom, have given a testimony against them,
they are to be reproved and testified against,
as out of the order of the gospel and practice of the holy men of God in former ages.

For we cannot expect to stand clear as a people before our enemies,
till we have faithfully endeavoured that all our meetings
and camp may be cleansed of all ungodliness whatsoever.
For God is pure and holy, and will have a people so,
and no unclean thing or person can stand in his court or presence;
and in this his glorious gospel day of life, light and glory,
the most spiritual ministration,
and the last and greatest that ever the world shall be visited with,
which in tender mercy and lovingkindness he has caused to dawn in us,
he will be glorified in, by and through us, or without us, and against us;
for his name he will exalt in righteousness over nations,
and he will overturn and overturn, till he come to rule, whose right it is,
in the hearts and consciences of the sons of men.

And dear friends, have a care of the love of the world, and the riches thereof;
do not choke the good seed of the kingdom of righteousness sown in you,
for the enemy lies near many in that respect, their care,
labour and industry being more for the food that perishes,
than for that which nourishes to eternal life.
Many grow cold in their love, zeal,
and affection to those weighty duties which God requires of us,
in meeting often together to wait upon him, to feel the operation of his divine power,
and his comfortable presence which has often opened
life and the treasures of it to our souls.
And as we have waited upon the Lord, we have renewed our strength,
and in meeting often together we have felt the Lord`'s presence in the midst of us,
so that we have not sought his face in vain;
all holy praises be returned to him forevermore.

And now beloved friends and brethren,
as the Lord in tender mercy has called us out of darkness,
to be children of his gospel day, let us not sleep as do others,
but with girded loins watch and be sober,
casting off all the unfruitful works of darkness, and put on the armour of light,
that we may be valiant soldiers in the army of the Lamb,
and be able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy.
For of a truth, the Lord is arisen to search his Jerusalem with candles,
and he will assuredly find out the hypocrite and the unclean,
and him who saved the wedge of gold, and the Babylonish garment,
though ever so closely hid in his tent;
for all things are naked and bare to his all-seeing eye.
Woe to him who is covered, and not with the Spirit of the Lord,
for he will be left naked to his own shame to the view of all beholders.

And all young friends, both male and female, who have believed in the Truth,
and are coming up in the world, beware of a careless, loose spirit,
for it will lay you open to many snares and temptations,
whereby you will be betrayed by the enemy of your souls into many noisome lusts,
which will drown you in perdition, if you give way thereto.
First seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
by walking in the Truth that you have believed in,
and then all other things needful for you will be given you of God,
and with them the blessing which will make you rich, and add no sorrow with it.
Take heed of seeking lawful things by unlawful means, for if you so obtain them,
they will wither under your hands.
Make not haste to be rich in this world, nor to lay up great things for your children,
lest it prove their snare and your sorrow.
Some of us have been young, and now are grown old,
yet in all our days we never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his seed,
who have walked in the way thereof to the end, begging their bread.

The way to be happy and prosperous in this world and that which is to come,
is first to breathe after righteousness, and walk in its way,
though for it you drink a bitter cup from the hands of men.
If you are willing to drink this for a time,
the sweet cup of blessing and consolation will be given you of God,
who keeps the best wine till the last,
and he will crown your grey hairs with honour and immortality.
Let not out your affections after the foolish, vain,
and frivolous fashions and customs of this world, for they will wither as the grass,
and fade as the flower thereof.
God Almighty direct your way, and keep you under the wing of his power,
in the pure religion which keeps unspotted of the world,
that the honourable name by which you are called, and in which you have been preserved,
as you have trusted in it, may be your rock, refuge, and tower to the end of your days;
Amen.

=== A General Epistle to the People of God, in Scorn Called Quakers, in England and Elsewhere.

Dear friends, brethren and sisters,

Unto whom the visitation of life in the Son of the Father`'s love has reached:
When you were as dry bones scattered upon the earth here and there,
the compassionate eye of a tender Father was towards you,
and his word breathed life into you, giving you knowledge and understanding,
and gathered you together to be his household of faith, in this latter age of the world.
The salutation of my dear and unfeigned,
fatherly and brotherly love at this time extends itself freely unto you all,
in the heavenly unity of that one Spirit of life, by which we were first quickened,
who were dead in trespasses and sins as well as others.

Oh! that grace, mercy, love and truth, with all the fruits of righteousness may grow,
increase, and be abundantly multiplied in and among you all.
This my soul daily breathes to the Lord on your behalf,
who are heirs together of the grace of God, being planted into the likeness of his Son,
to bear his heavenly image, and as living members,
fitly joined and framed together under one head, to be a complete body in him.
You are as living epistles written with the spirit
of the living God in one another`'s hearts,
who live and move in your integrity, and continue in your first love without wavering.
Here you daily have and receive mercies and blessings from above,
with a daily increase of life and virtue in your bosoms,
whereby your strength is renewed as the morning, and you need go no more forth,
for your bread is sure in your own houses, and springs of water in your own wells.
My soul blesses God in the remembrance of you,
who are made living monuments of his mercy,
and are daily waiting for the consolation of Israel`'s God,
who in this his glorious day is fulfilling his ancient promise in manifesting Him,
whose voice is not heard in the streets,
yet ordained of God to bring forth judgment to the gentiles,
and to be their light and glory.
This we are witnesses of in our day,
through the tender mercy of our God in visiting us
with his ancient gospel day springing from on high,
who sat in darkness as well as others, and were by nature the children of wrath.
When we thus laid polluted in our blood, he said unto us, Live,
and his word was an everlasting covenant.

Oh! let all who are made partakers of so great love and mercy,
live in the daily remembrance thereof,
and walk worthy of so great salvation in all humility and godly sincerity,
as lights in the world, that your good works may daily appear to them,
which are the proper effects of that living faith you have received from God.
By this alone your faith will be seen to live, and you in it;
for as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also.
And being planted into the likeness of Him who is from above, you may bear his image,
and be clothed with his righteousness,
for no other covering will hide your nakedness from the world,
nor keep your beauty and comeliness in the sight of God.

And now my beloved friends, brethren and sisters, who are of the household of faith,
seeing the Lord has chosen you to place his great name in, by the revelation of his Son,
which ages and generations before you knew not;
as sound and honourable vessels in the house of the Lord, keep your places and station,
and let your chaste conduct,
coupled with fear and gravity in every place where you dwell,
be seen and known unto all men.
For to this purpose were you called and separated from the ways, worships,
and evil customs of this present world, to be the first fruits in the Lord`'s vineyard,
which he has planted with his right hand in a very fruitful hill.
Oh! wait for his watering from on high,
which will be known and witnessed as your hearts are kept empty and open unto him,
for he is waiting to be gracious and bountiful to his chosen seed,
flock and family everywhere, who keep his word and covenant;
to them he is and will be as the shadow of a mighty rock,
though in a weary and desolate land.

But he will sift the nations in the sieve of his wrath, who have despised his word,
grace, life and consolation,
which are the root and moving cause of all true worship and service to him.
The corner-stone which Babel`'s builders have rejected as useless to them,
and think to reach heaven without, will bring confusion upon all religions on earth;
if they continue rejecting this stone, their buildings, though ever so high, will fall,
for the judgment is come,
and the fall of Babylon as a mill-stone into the sea is at hand,
and all her lovers who have made merchandize of the souls of men,
shall mourn and be astonished at her destruction.

And now my beloved friends and brethren, the Lord has called us out of her,
and has opened our eyes to see her abominations among all sorts of professions,
whose hearts and minds are adulterated from God,
though in words they make a large profession of him, yet in works deny him;
this is atheism in nature.
Look not back at her again, nor stay in her suburbs,
neither let anything of her language, customs, or nature remain,
for that will lead to depart from the living God and his heavenly Jerusalem,
to the love of her again, who is the mother of harlots and abomination of the earth.

Oh! the exceeding riches of the Father`'s love, who has not called us unto wrath,
but to obtain mercy, in turning every one of us from our iniquities,
who have loved and obeyed his Truth.
Therefore as dear children of one Father,
let us live in all humble subjection to Him who has begotten
us again unto a living hope by the word of his power,
to be the first fruits unto his glory in these latter ages of the world,
in which he will be glorified, in, by, and through us, or without us.
For of stones he can raise up children unto Abraham,
who shall glorify his name in the day of their visitation,
by walking in his light and covenant.
But if we walk in the light as children of the day, in watchfulness,
sobriety and honesty, we shall keep our holy union and fellowship one with another,
without jar or strife, debate or contention, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son,
we shall daily witness to cleanse us from our sin.
Then the good purpose of the Lord will be answered
in visiting us with his heavenly gospel day,
which dawned and sprung in our hearts,
by which the seat of antichrist has been discovered,
and the hidden things of Esau brought to light,
which nothing could manifest but the arising and appearance of
the Son of Righteousness in the hearts of the sons of men.
In this gospel day with which God has visited us,
are all false spirits upon the earth discerned, and every deed of darkness manifested,
yes, the very seat of antichrist discovered.
In the first breaking forth of this day, God made us a willing people,
and put upon us the helmet of salvation, and girded us with the sword of the spirit,
and made us able to war with the dragon and his power,
and through faith gave us many and great victories; indeed,
we were made more than conquerors.

Oh! the sweet remembrance of this day is now with me, who am warned to warn you,
to live in a daily sense and consideration of the height, depth,
breadth and length of the love of God, and his tender mercy towards us,
who were by nature children of wrath as well as others,
and sat in darkness and in the region of the shadow of death.
And when we recount the vile sort of men, we can say such were some of us;
but God has mercifully washed our garments in the blood of his dear Son,
and has put upon us the garments of praise for the spirit of heaviness,
which surrounded us in the long and dark night of apostasy,
which has been over the world for ages and generations before we had our being;
but the darkness is past, and the true light now shines.

Oh! that the remembrance of the exceeding riches
and kindness which God has manifested in us,
may ever be with us,
and that we may walk worthy of so high a calling in all holy conduct and godliness.
For to this end were we called and separated from among many,
to be the first fruits unto God in this latter age of the world,
and hereby will his name be renowned throughout the world by us,
as we daily walk in a holy conduct coupled with fear, lowliness, and tenderness;
for so is our subjection to him manifested, and the same witness which we have received,
will be reached and raised in the hearts and consciences of the sons of men,
who will not otherwise be reached,
and they will bless God on our behalf in the day of their visitation.

But if any walk loosely, and let go the girdle of Truth,
and begin to eat and drink with the drunkards, and to contend with,
or beat their fellow servants, or draw back into a fleshly liberty,
whereby the cross of Christ is thrown aside, neglected and despised,
"`the Lord of that servant will appear in a day when he is least aware of him,
and appoint him his portion with hypocrites, where is weeping forever.`"
For God will not now be mocked with any people or profession;
they who sow to the flesh shall die, wither and inherit corruption;
but they who sow to the Spirit of Truth, and walk in its law, shall live and flourish,
and reap life and virtue daily.
For its ministration is the last and greatest the world shall be visited with,
whereby life and immortality shall again appear to all nations, kindreds,
and tongues upon the face of the earth; if they receive and walk in.
It is ordained of God to be the guide of life to all the sons and daughters of Adam,
to lead them out of the fall into the way of peace,
and shall fulfill the last and great prophecy, Rev. 21:24,
"`That the nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of the Lamb,
and the kings of the earth, shall bring their glory and honour unto it,
and the glory and honour of the gentiles shall be brought unto it,`" ver. 26.

This is begun to be fulfilled in the earth,
and many are come and coming to the brightness of his rising,
whose coming is as the light which arises in the east and shines to the west,
that none may be left unvisited with his glory.
But all who shut their eyes from this glorious Sun shall have no benefit by his appearance,
but shall stumble and fall, and rise no more unto life, peace, and salvation,
and shall die in their sins, and perish in their unrighteousness.
For none can have the benefit either of the death, passion, or resurrection of Jesus,
purposed of God for all mankind, but those who believe, receive and follow him,
who went before and trod the wine-press alone.
And as the rejecting of him in his outward appearance, was the ruin of the outward Jews,
even so the despising of him in his inward and spiritual appearance
will be the ruin and downfall of the outward Christians;
this testimony I must leave to the world,
and it shall live and be fulfilled when I am gone from here, no more to be seen.

But you, my dearly beloved friends and brethren, who have accepted of this day,
and have opened your eyes to behold the glorious Son of righteousness,
who is now risen with healing in his wings, let your moderation appear to all men,
and walk honestly as in the day,
and keep on your breast-plate of faith that the enemy wound you not,
for your safety is within your spiritual armour,
in your holy mountain where no devourer can come.

And though the Lord has taken peace from the earth, where righteousness dwells not,
and one mountain rises against another and they beat one another to dust,
be not troubled at these things for they must be, and also famines,
pestilences and earthquakes in various places: they are but the beginning of sorrows,
to them who have despised the mercy and long-suffering of the Lord,
and slighted and neglected the day of their visitation, which has been for many years,
in which he has striven with them by his spirit,
and has waited to be good and gracious to the worst of men;
but they have not known or considered in this their day,
the things which belong to their peace.
I pray God it be not hid from their eyes.
But we are commanded to say, whatever befalls the world,
it shall go well with the righteous in it; therefore stand still in your tent doors,
and quietly wait to see the salvation of God through all
these overturnings which he allows to be in the earth.

Often would the Lord have gathered England under the shadow of his wing and power,
but they +++[+++I mean the greater part]
have refused to be gathered, and hate to be reformed; of this I am a living witness.
They were invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb, but they have made excuses, yes,
willful and obstinate refusals to come,
which has kindled the wrath of the Master of the feast,
to say they shall not taste at my table.
And he will invite other guests more hungry and willing to come, who shall fill his house.
Of this we have been, and may yet be more eye-witnesses;
for he is shaking the earth and heavens, that that which is to be shaken may be removed,
that the foundation which cannot be shaken may remain sure forever.
And he will gather his sheep out of all kingdoms,
and from all barren mountains where they have been
scattered in this cloudy and dark night,
which has continued for ages and generations before us.

Therefore dear friends, lift up your heads in the dominion of God`'s power,
of which you are made partakers, for your deliverance by it,
if you continue in it to the end, is determined of God;
let none expect deliverance by outward might or power, that is by the arm of flesh,
for that will fail and wither as the grass.
But in Mount Zion is deliverance, according to the word of the Lord,
and in the remnant whom he has chosen.
So mind not the bustles and hurryings in the world, nor the overturnings among men,
for through all these things will the Lord set up the kingdom of his beloved Son,
which is a spiritual kingdom of peace and righteousness.

The earth was filled with violence before the flood; and as it was in the days of Noah,
so it is at the coming of the Son of Man;
and had Noah joined with the violence of the old world, he had been drowned with them,
but he loved righteousness, and walked in it before the Lord in that generation;
and therefore the Lord had mercy upon him,
and delivered him from that general destruction which drowned the world of ungodly men.

The earth is now filled with violence, and corrupted through iniquity,
and the Lord has begun to visit the nation with his sore displeasure;
therefore to your habitation in the Lord, Oh! you his Israel.
Power is given to the devourer, who is without, to destroy much flesh;
the unbaptized in heart shall fall by the sword of the Lord,
who have resisted his holy Spirit, as did the uncircumcised in the days of old.
This was, is, and will be the ruin of all empty professors upon the earth;
for he is not a Christian that is one outwardly,
neither is that baptism that is outward in the flesh;
but he is a Christian who is one inwardly;
and baptism is that of the heart in the Spirit, whose praise is not of men, but of God.
And the saving knowledge of Christ is not after the flesh, 2 Cor. 5:16,
"`For henceforth know we him so no more,`" that is after the flesh;
and no man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God.
This must be received, and knowledge waited for, by and through this,
which alone is ordained of God to give to all mankind knowledge
and understanding in things relating to his kingdom:
it is the root and foundation of all true religion,
and without it there is none true in the earth.
The true worship stands in it now as in times past, which shall end the temple worship,
that stands in bodily exercise; it will be left to be trodden down of the Gentiles,
for it is the outward court, where the glory of God shines not;
but in the inward court are spiritual worshippers before the altar,
where the presence of God opens life and the treasury of it to the soul,
which they partake of, who wait to be renewed in spirit before the Lord.

And now my beloved friends and brethren, as we are made complete in him,
our heavenly Head, let a holy and heavenly harmony be continued among us,
for unity is our strength; therefore labour to retain and keep it everywhere,
that every member of the body may be nourished and
kept alive by virtue of the life within.
Have a tender care of disjoining any living member,
but let all be edified together in love,
and every member act in its place to the honour of the Head.
And above all, keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,
for so is the will of God concerning us,
that our sons may be as plants growing up in their youth,
walking in the steps of their fathers,
and our daughters as virgins with their lamps trimmed and burning,
waiting for the Bridegroom.
Be steadfast in him, and in the word of his grace,
and keep the holy order of the gospel without wavering;
and let every wholesome order that is established among you,
which is comely and of good report, be kept up and practised,
and keep the reign of Truth and power of God over every evil-doer, without partiality;
so will the Lord crown you with dominion over the power of darkness everywhere.
For the true light of which we have borne testimony, is the seed of the kingdom of God,
which must increase till by it the knowledge of the glory
of God again covers the earth as the waters cover the sea;
therefore cherish this seed everywhere, in whomsoever it is arising;
for it is the life and power of godliness, not the form,
that must enrich the world with righteousness, and fill the earth with blessings.

And if we, or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel,
or proclaim any other name than that which you have received,
and in which you have believed and found salvation and deliverance,
receive us not into your houses; for God is one, and his name one,
and there is not another by which any man can be saved.
And this name is Jesus the anointed of God the Father,
who is now come to save his people from, not in, their sin, +++[+++mark that];
for so he was God`'s salvation in the true gospel day,
and so we have proclaimed him in our day, and many have so received him,
to whom he has given power to become his sons and daughters,
servants and handmaids in his house, who are his flock and family, and have bread enough,
and living water in their own vessels, and none need go forth;
all holy praises be given to the Lord, and to the Lamb forever and ever.

Finally, dear friends and brethren, be strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might,
and the God of peace be with you all, strengthen, stablish,
settle you upon the Rock of ages, in full and perfect unity with God,
and one with another, in which I bid you all farewell;
and remain your true friend and brother in the bond of love and peace,

Ambrose Rigge.

=== Consideration of True and Acceptable Worship

The deep and weighty consideration of the true and
acceptable worship and service of Almighty God,
who is an unlimited spirit of life, light and glory, has been upon me from year to year,
since he first opened my eyes to see and know what was good and acceptable in his sight.
To wait diligently upon him, in the true silence of all flesh;
to know what is his good and perfect will, and with what to come before him,
and what offering is and has been acceptable to him, whether prayer, praises,
preaching or silence;
all or any of which being performed as he requires in a broken and contrite spirit,
trembling at his word; this both is, and ever was acceptable to him,
as he spoke by that evangelical prophet Isaiah 66:2. And all other service or sacrifice,
though ever so glorious, which is brought forth in the will and wit of man,
being ever so finely polished with eloquent phrases,
is but as the cutting off a dog`'s neck, or offering swine`'s blood,
which is an abomination in the eye of the pure God.

His worship is not limited to day, time, or place, forms, words or names;
but is spiritual and only performed by them who are
given up to be led and guided by his Spirit,
in every duty which he requires of them.
These are the spiritual worshippers within the temple,
who offer up their hearts as a living sacrifice to God, in the flames of Divine love,
and who can wait upon him, in true poverty of spirit till he kindles the sacrifice.
This is the ancient gospel-worship which our Lord and Saviour taught the woman of Samaria,
John 4:23-24, and which he is now teaching his sons and daughters,
servants and handmaids, who are given up to wait upon Him, to know his Divine pleasure,
what he will require of them;
for that alone is acceptable to him which is of his own preparing;
therefore he gave Israel his good Spirit to direct them in his worship and service, Neh. 9:20.
And in the clear gospel-ministration,
his worship was not limited to Jerusalem, or the mount, or the temple,
or to any set form,
but the true worshippers are to worship the Father in spirit and truth,
for such he then sought, and is now seeking to worship him.

But oh! how far different are the many forms of worship in this land,
which are invented and brought forth in the will and wit of fallen man,
for private and sinister ends.
When they come together to offer, without any deliberation,
or waiting to know the good will and pleasure of God,
they speak a divination of their own brain-study,
giving to God just as much as they think fitting, or have shaped into a form,
and he must accept of that, or nothing; and when so much is said over,
then worship is done.

How would a prince, or a potentate of the earth, be pleased that his servant,
upon all occasions, should rush into his presence, and immediately give that to him,
which he never required of him, neither commanded him to prepare for him?
Will not the master judge it presumption in the servant
thus to deal with him from year to year?
May not he rather justly say to the servant, It is your duty to wait upon me,
to know my pleasure, and to offer to me what I command you;
and reject him and his offering?

And shall not the just and righteous God, reject all such offerings in this day,
and say as once he did to Israel of old; Isaiah the first, to the 20th,
Who required these things at your hands?
And, Behold, all you that kindle a fire; that compass yourselves about with sparks;
walk in the light of your fire, and in the sparks that you have kindled;
this shall you have of my hand, you shall lie down in sorrow, Isa. 50:11.

And what are all your formal services and sermons,
collected together in the will and wisdom of man for money,
but sparks of your own kindling; and saying, Thus says the Lord,
when the Lord never spoke to you--like the false prophets of Israel, Ezek.
13th. Oh! repent, repent; sit down in sackcloth and ashes;
let your laughter be turned into mourning, your feasts into fasting,
and your joy into heaviness.
For the Lord is arisen to search all professions upon the earth,
and woe to them who are covered, and not with the Spirit of the Lord,
for the day that is approaching, shall try every man`'s works,
whether they are wrought in God, by the motion of his Spirit, or not.
And now the skirts of the false church he will fully discover to her shame and confusion:
and her merchants he will bring more and more into contempt,
who have traded with slaves and souls of men, Rev.
18th, and through covetousness have made merchandize of the people for many ages,
2 Pet. 2, in this long and dark night of apostasy since the apostles`' days.
The hour of her judgment is come, and the Judge stands at the door; let all who fear God,
and are willing to obey his word, come out of her, and partake not with her in her sins,
lest you partake of her plagues.
From a lover of the souls of all men,

Ambrose Rigge.
