=== Preface

[.salutation]
Gentle and Courteous Reader:

In this small book are many weighty matters laid down to thy serious consideration,
even the things which belong to thy eternal peace with God;
therefore be not rash nor hasty to judge of any thing herein,
which may be above thy capacity,
but wait in that measure of the gift of grace which God hath bestowed upon thee,
that it may lead thee in the path of righteousness;
so will these heavenly mysteries be unfolded unto thee.
And if in any thing thou be contrary minded, God shall reveal even this unto thee;
for he revealeth secrets, and the light dwelleth with him.
And as no man knows the things of man, save the spirit of man, that is in him;
so no man knows the things of God, save the Spirit of God.
Therefore if thou wouldst know whether these things
in this little volume be of God or no,
return to the manifestation of God`'s spirit,
which he hath given to thee to profit withal; this will be as the key of David unto thee,
and will open unto thee these things, and no man shall shut them from thee;
but if thou shut them from thee, no man shall open them to thee:
therefore unto this I recommend thee, and remain thine to serve in love,

In the beginning God made man upright, Ecc. 7:29,
perfect and complete in his own image, Gen. 1:26-27,
which was righteousness and true holiness, and gave him divers commandments,
and also power to keep and observe them,
while he stood in that perfect image in which he was created;
who in that state was a son of God, and heir of life,
and had the tree of life freely given him to be his food, that he might live forever.
But out of that state the serpent led him to sin and break covenant with God,
whereby he lost that perfection of holiness in which he stood complete,
while he kept covenant with God.
And also was dispossessed of that power by which he kept the commands of God;
and so all his posterity died in him from that power
and perfection of holiness in which man was created,
and fell into Satan`'s kingdom, which is sin and imperfection; and so were,
and always have been, led captive at his will into many noisome lusts,
which have drowned thousands in perdition.
But as in Adam all died, so in Christ shall all be made alive. 1 Cor. 15:22.

These glad tidings of life, salvation and redemption,
were general to all mankind without respect of persons, who would hear and obey him,
by whom God in his eternal purpose would restore man into his first estate,
viz.
by Christ the second Adam, according to his word by Isaiah the prophet,
who said that Zion should be redeemed through judgment,
and her converts with righteousness, Isa. 1:27.
He also said he would restore her judges, as at the first,
and her counsellors as at the beginning,
and afterwards she should be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city, verse 26.
This was the first promise of man`'s restoration
into that perfection of holiness in which he was created.

And he prophesied of the coming and kingdom of Christ, and said,
It shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the
Lord`'s house shall be established in the top of the mountains:
and many people should say, Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord,
to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways,
and we will walk therein, Isa. 2:2-3.
And the same prophet cried unto the house of Jacob, and said, Come ye,
and let us walk in the light of the Lord, Isa. 2:5. Here was the way of God,
which was his light, prophesied of, to lead man again to God, from whence he was fallen,
who afterwards came to lead the Israel of God in all his ways;
as hereafter I shall fully declare.

The same prophet said, Christ`'s kingdom should be a tabernacle,
when the Lord had washed away the filth of the daughter
of Zion by the spirit of judgment and burning, Isa. 4:4-6.
He saw in a vision the stubbornness of many, to their own destruction,
and said they would make their hearts fat, and their ears heavy, and would not hear;
and shut their eyes, lest they should see,
until their cities were wasted without inhabitant, and their houses without men, Isa. 6:10-11.
But said, in it there should be a remnant,
which should be as a teil-tree, or as an oak,
whose substance was in them when they cast their leaves,
so the holy seed should be the substance thereof, Isa. 6:13,
which afterwards was fulfilled; for Christ the holy seed was after,
in the remnant that was saved, as the substance remained in the teil-tree or oak,
when their leaves were cast.
This was also a certain testimony of the Son of God,
who was set for the fall and the rising again of many in Israel, Luke 2:34,
who was to be manifested in man, to restore him to his first estate,
as the apostles at large afterwards witnessed.

The same prophet also prophesied of the birth of this second Adam,
and of his kingdom and government, Isa. 9:6-7. And said,
the remnant of the house of Jacob should no more stay upon him who smote them,
but should stay upon the Lord, the holy one of Israel;
and should return unto the mighty God, Isa. 10:20-21, as afterwards it came to pass.
And again he testified of the peaceable kingdom of Christ,
wherein the earth should be filled with the knowledge of God,
as the waters cover the sea, Isa. 11:1-9,
which knowledge came afterwards to be received by the light
which God had commanded to shine in their hearts,
who were witnesses of the same, 2 Cor. 4:6, by which,
the light of the knowledge of the glory of God was received in the face of Jesus Christ.
Again, the Lord by the prophet, Isa. 4:1,
called every one that thirsted to drink freely of the waters of life,
without money and without price; and called many to repentance, verse, 6, and said,
Let the wicked forsake his ways, and the unrighteous man his thoughts,
and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him; verse 7.
Here was the promise of mercy unto man,
if he forsook his unrighteous ways and thoughts; and to no other,
as afterwards was testified, Prov. 28:13.
And furthermore the prophet declareth the glory of the true church,
and saith, the Gentiles shall come to her light,
and kings to the brightness of her rising, Isaiah 60:3, which was afterwards fulfilled.

All which prophesies were the universal love of God in Christ Jesus to mankind,
for his restoration into that image and perfection of holiness in which he was created;
so that to all who received him when he came to be manifested to them,
he gave power to become the sons of God, and heirs of life, John 1:12.

And Jeremiah also prophesied of the scattered flock of the Lord,
whom the wicked pastors of Israel had destroyed. And the Lord said,
I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all countries where they have been driven,
and will bring them again into their fold, and will set one Shepherd over them,
which shall feed them, Jer. 23.
And in his days Judah shall be saved,
and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called,
The Lord our righteousness; verse 6.
And they shall no more say, The Lord liveth,
which brought the children of Israel out of Egypt,
but the Lord liveth which brought the seed of the house of Jacob out of the north country,
and out of all countries whither he had driven them;
verses 7-8. All which the Lord spoke by way of prophesy, that he would restore Israel,
his people, unto unity with him,
which could not possibly be until he had finished transgression in them,
which was the first cause of separation from God and the glory of his power.

And again, the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah prophesied of the restoration of Israel,
and said, he would bring them from the north country,
and gather them from the coasts of the earth;
he that scattered Israel will gather them as a shepherd doth his flock, Jer. 31:10.
And also said, he would make a covenant with the house of Israel,
and the house of Judah,
not according to the covenant which he made with their fathers when he
took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt,
(mark!) but this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel;
I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts;
and they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying,
Know the Lord, etc. Jer. 31:31-33.
This is the covenant in which Christ was promised,
wherein God would write his law in his people`'s hearts,
which afterwards the apostles witnessed,
and in which they knew the blood of Christ to cleanse them from all sin, 1 John 1:7.
This covenant was a covenant of light, and of life,
and they were justified by faith, Gal. 3:24,
and so were presented blameless unto God,
which the blood of bulls and goats could not do, nor any outward thing, Heb. 10:4.

And by the mouth of Ezekiel, the Lord promised to gather his people again unto himself,
and seek them as a shepherd seeketh his sheep, and feed them in a good pasture, Ezek. 34:12-16.
Here was God`'s universal love again manifested by way of prophecy,
for the recovery of lost man; all which promises were made conditionally unto mankind,
if they believed in him whom God hath chosen to be the author of eternal salvation,
to all who receive and believe in him.

Then afterwards Daniel prophesied of the suffering of the Son of God,
of whom the prophets had written,
whom the angel showed that seventy weeks were determined to finish transgression,
and to make an end of sin, and to make reconciliation for iniquity,
and to bring in everlasting righteousness, Dan. 9:24

And in verse 26th +++[+++it]
saith, That after sixty-two weeks shall the Messiah be slain, but not for himself;
and in verse 27th, He shall confirm the covenant with many for one week,
and in the midst of the week he shall cause the offerings and the oblations to cease.

This showed the death of the Son of God, before he came into the world,
by which sin and transgression were to be finished,
which were the cause of offerings and sacrifices,
still demonstrating God`'s eternal purpose through him,
to put an end to transgression in man, without which man could never come to him again,
nor be restored into that image and glory which he lost by transgression,
which is the perfection of holiness in the sight of the Lord,
which the apostles testified unto, 2 Cor. 7:1,
that man might live with God in the spirit, for which end he was created,
which was brought to pass through the death and suffering of his Son,
whom he sent into the world, that they through him might be saved, John 3:17.

And the Lord spake again by the mouth of Amos, and said,
The ploughman should overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth seed;
and the mountains should drop down with sweet wine,
and he would bring again the captivity of his people Israel,`" Amos 9:13-14.

And Micah foretold of the birth of this Saviour, even in Bethlehem Ephratah,
though it was little among the thousands of Judah,
yet out of it should He come forth that was to be ruler in Israel;
whose goings forth have been from old, from everlasting;
and he shall stand and rule in the strength of the Lord,
and in the majesty of the name of the Lord,
and shall be great unto the ends of the earth, Micah 5:2-4.

And also said, that the remnant of Israel should be among many nations,
as a dew from the Lord that tarrieth not for man,
and as the showers upon the tender grass, etc.
And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles,
as a lion among the beasts of the forest;
and as a young lion among the flocks of the sheep; which should rouse them,
and go through, and none can deliver, ver. 7-8.

All which prophecies being so clear and full,
both of the birth and coming of the Son of God,
and of his perfecting the work of the Lord, which is to destroy the works of the devil,
and restore man into that image and glory of God, which he lost by transgression;
that he who runs may read it, Hab. 2:2.
This was the very end for which he was manifested,
and for which he died and rose again, according to the Scriptures.

So when He was come of whom the prophets gave testimony, and born in Bethlehem of Judea,
Matt. 2:1; Luke 2:4, He began to do many mighty works and wonders,
in restoring the blind to sight, and the lame to walk, and the deaf to hear,
as it is written of him, Mark 7:37; whose work was always a work of perfection,
both in his restoration of body and soul, who saved to the uttermost,
all who came to God by him, Heb. 7:25, and made man every whit whole, John 7:23.
He did not leave his work imperfect, in or upon them who did believe in him;
for then he had done no more than did the old covenant,
which was disannulled because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof;
because it made not the comers thereunto perfect; for then it should have ceased,
Heb. 10:1-2, but he hath obtained a more excellent ministry;
by how much also he is become a Mediator of a better covenant,
which was established upon better promises,
Heb.8:6. For if perfection had been by the Levitical priesthood,
under which the law was received,
what further need was there that another priesthood
should arise after the order of Melchizedek,
and not be called after the order of Aaron? Heb. 7:11.

The first priesthood, with all its offerings and sacrifices, evening and morning,
and with all its rites and ceremonies, could not make the comers thereunto perfect;
and the law, with all its works, could never justify any, nor make any thing perfect, Heb. 7:19.
Therefore Moses did but obtain a servant`'s place,
yet being faithful therein, according to what God had manifested, Heb. 3:2,5,
he was called the friend of God, in doing whatsoever he commanded him,
and laid down his head in peace in the land of Moab;
according to the word of the Lord, Duet. 5:4-5.
Though that priesthood had not then appeared,
through which the perfection of holiness was afterwards witnessed,
nor power to become the sons of God--but only servants,
who doing what the Lord commanded them, it was well-pleasing to God,
and he blessed them in their generation.

God also blessed Abraham in his generation, because he obeyed his word and commandment,
and withheld not his only son, at the commandment of the Lord, Genesis 22:8-12.
He believed in God, and obeyed his word;
therefore he died in a good old age, an old man and full of years,
and was gathered unto his people, Gen. 25:8. And God said unto him,
because thou hast done this; and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son; in blessing,
I will bless thee, and in multiplying, I will multiply thy seed;
and make it as the stars of heaven, and as the sand upon the seashore, etc., Gen. 22:16-17.

And David did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord,
and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded him, all the days of his life;
save only in the matter of Uriah the Hittite, 1 Kings 15:5.
For this he suffered the severe judgment of the Lord,
so that he laid roaring all the day long, and watered his couch with his tears,
Ps. 22:1; Ps. 32:3. By this judgment he was redeemed again unto God,
and became a vessel of honour, to sound forth the praises of God, Ps. 93;
Ps. 101 and 103 and 104. After which he departed not from the law of God,
but continued in the same unto the end of his days.

Many others of the faithful servants of the Lord, who obeyed his word and commandments,
I might mention, both in the time of the law and the prophets, who kept the commandments,
laws, statutes and ordinances of God; in the keeping of which, he promised life unto man,
Lev. 8:5; Ezek. 20:11. These laws, statutes and judgments, were given to Israel;
but they despised them, and polluted his sabbaths;
therefore he poured forth his fury upon them in the wilderness to consume them, Ezek. 20:13.
And all that went on in breaking his laws and commandments,
he overthrew in the wilderness, and they never came into the promised land: 1 Cor. 10:5.

Now these things were examples to them that came after,
that they should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted; verse 6.

Neither to be idolaters, as were some of them, as it is written;
the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play, Ex. 32:6.; 1 Cor. 10:7.
This was counted idolatry, the which many are found in at this day,
who cannot endure so to be called; though we know that no unclean person,
nor covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ,
nor of God: Eph. 5:3-5.

And the apostle said, Let no man deceive you with vain words,
for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience; verse 6.

Here follows some of Leonard Letchford`'s doctrines, by way of query,
lately published in two or three papers sent to me,
which I shall compare with the writings of the holy men of God,
which I have before asserted; who lived but in the days of the first covenant,
and the prophets; in which the law and commandments of God were given forth;
yet they were blessed in the keeping of them, as I have before shown.
Leonard Letchford hath lately sought to persuade me, that it would be praise to God,
for me to say the commandments of God could not be done without sinning,
as he and his brethren have long believed, and caused many to believe,
to their own destruction.
Thus they have kept people in sin and transgression, and imperfection;
for which they have long pleaded,
and do yet plead for their disobedience to God`'s law and commandments,
from some failings of the servants of God before mentioned;
which were only written to warn all not to tempt the Lord; as some of them tempted him,
many of whom were destroyed in their rebellion and disobedience;
but they who were willing and obedient, came to eat the good of the land of promise.
And none of them did answer the Lord when he gave them his laws, statutes,
and ordinances, commandments and precepts, and say it cannot be done,
as Leonard Letchford of Hurst Pierpoint.

The paper is as followeth, September 6, 1663.

[.embedded-content-document.paper]
--

Whether to do good, and not to commit sin,
be a perfection that any man dares challenge whilst he lives on earth,
or whether it be possible for any man so to keep God`'s commandments,
and to observe his righteous law, as to say any day I have not offended,
I have no need to say forgive me in any thing wherein I have done amiss?
This was the question.

By which I have struck the devil dumb in the Quaker`'s Oracle at Horsham,
known to the world by the name of Ambrose Rigge; Lord open his lips,
that his mouth may show forth thy praise, in saying plainly it cannot be done.

Now Moses and Abraham, as I have before asserted,
to whom the law and commandments were given forth, did so keep them, and observe them,
that the breach of them was never charged to them,
but they were blessed in the keeping and doing of them.
David turned not aside from any of the commandments of God all his days,
save in the matter of Uriah; and many more,
who kept God`'s laws and commandments all the days of their lives,
and were blessed and their posterity after them, and praised God with an upright heart,
in their obedience to the law and commandments of God.
And none of them did ever say, Lord open my mouth,
that my lips may show forth thy praise,
in saying plainly thy commandments cannot be done, as Leonard Letchford doth.
If they did, show when or where any such doctrine was preached by any,
either in the first covenant or the second,
or else let those faithful servants of God afore mentioned,
who kept God`'s law and commandments, and did live with God in them,
be witnesses against those who would have people believe it cannot be done.

1+++.+++ Christ saith, after he had given forth many commandments unto the people;
He that breaketh one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so,
he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whosoever shall do and teach them,

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me;
and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him,
and manifest myself to him, John 14:21.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another, John 13:34.

5+++.+++ If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love,

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my sayings,
he shall never see death, John 8:51.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ All which promises were made unto his disciples upon this condition,
that they kept his commandments, and not otherwise.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ To which the disciples answered, not as Leonard Letchford doth,
in saying it cannot be done, and count this praise to God: but they said,
Hereby we know that we know him, if we keep his commandments, 1 John 2:3.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ Again they spoke in reproof of those who should say they knew God,
and kept not his commandments, and said, such were liars,
and the truth was not in them, 1 John 2:4.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ Furthermore they testified, That whatsoever they asked, they received of him,
because they kept his commandments, 1 John 3:22.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ He that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him;
and hereby they knew that he did abide in them, by the Spirit which he gave them;
this was their proof of him in the days of old,
which is now so much condemned and cried against by Leonard Letchford,
and men of his coat, who saith, none can exactly keep the commands of God, 1 John 3:24.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ And by this they knew they loved the children of God, when they loved God,
and kept his commandments, 1 John 5:2.

[.numbered]
13+++.+++ Again they said, This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,
and his commandments are not grievous, 1 John 5:3.

Harken, Leonard Letchford, Art not thou of another mind, who would have people say,
It cannot be done?
May not all these rise up in judgment against thee?

[.numbered]
14+++.+++ And this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, 1 John 5:3.

====

All these gave testimony, how they kept his commandments,
through which their love was manifested to him, and for so doing,
had no cause to repent any day, nor to ask forgiveness of the Lord;
but yet Christ in their infancy taught them to say, Forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive them that trespass against us, Matt. 6:12;
but this was before Christ was offered up,
who purged their consciences from dead works by the blood of his cross,
through the eternal Spirit, by which he cleansed them from all sin,
and sanctified them in body, soul, and spirit, which as they grew up unto God in stature,
they bear witness unto.

Priest Letchford`'s Query.

Whether to do good, and not to commit sin,
be a perfection that any man dares challenge while he is upon the earth?

--

Which plainly demonstrates, that he is against doing good, and for committing of sin,
and denies perfection while people are upon the earth;
which is absolutely contrary to the doctrine of Christ and his apostles,
and makes the coming, suffering and blood of Christ of none effect.

[.numbered-group]
====

[.numbered]
1+++.+++ It is contrary to the doctrine of Christ, Matt. 5:48; who said to his disciples,
Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect;
which is a perfection of holiness and freedom from sin;
for otherwise they could not be perfect, as their heavenly Father was perfect.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ Christ said unto the young man who had kept the commandments from his youth,
If thou wilt be perfect, sell that thou hast, and give to the poor,
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven, and come and follow me, Matt. 19:21.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ It is contrary to Christ`'s prayer, John 17:23;
who desired that they whom God had given him might be one, as he and his Father was one:
He in them, and they in him, that they might be made perfect in one, etc.,
which could never be till sin and transgression was finished,
which was the first cause of separation.

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ To say that none can be perfect while he is upon the earth,
is contrary to Christ`'s words, who said,
Every one that is perfect shall be as his Master, Luke 6:40,
which agrees with his words, Matt. 5:48.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ It is contrary to the doctrine of Paul, who said,
We speak wisdom among them that are perfect, 1 Cor. 2:6.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ It is contrary to the apostle`'s exhortation, 2 Cor. 13:11.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ It is contrary to all the gifts that were given to the apostles,
which were for the perfecting of the saints for the work of the ministry,
for the edifying of the body of Christ, Till they all came into the unity of the faith,
and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man,
unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, Eph. 4:11-13;
this was a large measure of perfection indeed, which they testified of,
which afterwards was fulfilled in them.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ To say that none can be perfect while he is upon earth,
makes Paul`'s words to the Philippians false;
who though he had not then attained to perfection, either were already perfect;
he did not say as Leonard Letchford doth, that none could be perfect on earth, but said,
he followed after it, Phil. 3:12;
and pressed toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus, verse 14.
Let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded;
and if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal this unto you, Phil. 3:15.
It seems some were ready to be of another mind then, as many are now,
unto whom this was not fully revealed; to whom Paul said, Whereunto we have attained,
let us walk by the same rule; let us mind the same thing, verse 16.
So that it is clearly manifest that there
were degrees of growth in the gift of God,
before they came to perfection,
for Paul was not perfect while he had a body of sin in him;
and the rest were not perfect as soon as they came to be convinced and believe;
but first witnessed a warfare against sin, and the power of it,
and afterwards came to be freed from sin, and have victory over it, Rom. 6:17-21;
1 John 5:4, and then grew up to perfect men in Christ,
to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ; and said,
by this was their love made perfect,
that they might have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is,
so were they in this world, 1 John 4:17.

If Leonard Letchford had been amongst them then,
surely he would have cried out against them for so saying,
and his unbelieving heart would not have received this doctrine,
any more than he can now: for if Christ`'s work had effected no more,
but to leave his people still in their sins,
he had done no more than the old covenant did,
and his blood had been no more availing than the blood of bulls and goats,
which could not take away sin,
nor his offering of more force than the offerings of the old covenant,
which did not make the comers thereunto perfect, Heb. 10:1; and so were disannulled,
because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof, Heb. 7:18.
For the law made nothing perfect,
but the bringing in of a better hope did, verse 19;
(mark) the bringing in of a better hope did;
this better hope was Christ in them the hope of glory.
Col. 1:27; who when he was brought within the saints, made them perfect,
even as he was in this world.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ This Christ in the saints the apostles preached, warning every man,
and teaching every man in all wisdom,
that they might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus, Col. 1:28.
This was the end of their preaching,
to present every man perfect in Christ: and if any man be in Christ,
he is a new creature, old things are past away, (mark that) old things past away,
which were sin and transgression, and all things are become new, 2 Cor. 5:17.
Here is the new man who is created in Christ Jesus to good works,
that he should walk in them, Eph. 2:10. Here are good works,
in which they were to walk who were new creatures, without which their faith was dead,
even as a body without a spirit, James 2:26.
I suppose this may stop Leonard Letchford`'s mouth from asking,
whether to do good,
and not to commit sin be a perfection that any man dares challenge while he is on earth, etc.
It seems he dares challenge committing of sin,
but not doing good while he is upon the earth;
and so when all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God,
and shall come forth, they that have done good unto the resurrection of life;
he that hath done evil and committed sin,
shall rise unto the resurrection of condemnation, John 5:28-29.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ To say that nothing can be perfect upon the earth,
is against the apostle`'s fervent labour in prayers for the saints, which was,
that they might stand perfect and complete in all the will of God, Col. 4:12.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ It is against the end for which the Scripture was given forth, which was,
that the man of God might be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto every good work, 2 Tim. 3:17.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ It is contrary to the apostle`'s exhortation,
to say that none can be perfect on earth, who said, let us go on to perfection,
not laying again the foundation of repentance, etc. Heb. 6:1.
And these things we will do if God permit, verse 3.

[.numbered]
13+++.+++ It is contrary to the exhortation of James, who said,
let patience have its perfect work, that ye may be perfect and entire, wanting nothing,
James 1:4; and said, if any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man,
and able also to bridle the whole body, James 3:2.

[.numbered]
14+++.+++ It is contrary to Peter`'s prayer, who prayed, that the God of all grace,
who hath called us unto his eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after ye have suffered awhile,
make you perfect, etc. 1 Pet. 5:10.

[.numbered]
15+++.+++ To say that men must commit sin while they are upon the earth,
is contrary to the whole body of the Scripture,
and was never affirmed by any of the holy men of God,
but by such deceivers as Leonard Letchford hath proved himself so to be,
by pleading the devil`'s cause so frequently,
which is to keep people in sin for term of life, which if he can by any means do,
he knows they must come to him at the last, because the Son of God hath spoken it, Luke 8:27.

[.numbered]
16+++.+++ It is contrary to all these plain Scripture proofs, John 8:1,34 John 3:4,
1 John 3:8, He that committeth sin is of the devil, etc.

[.numbered]
17+++.+++ To say that none can be perfect,
doth make void the apostle`'s prayers for the Hebrews, when he parted from them;
who prayed, that the God of peace,
that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus Christ, that great Shepherd of the sheep,
through the blood of the everlasting covenant,
make you perfect in every good work to do his will, Heb. 13:20-21.

[.numbered]
18+++.+++ To say that none can be perfect on earth, makes Paul a liar, who said to the Hebrews,
But ye are come to Mount Zion, unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem,
to the innumerable company of angels, Heb. 12:22.
To the general assembly and church
of the first-born which are written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all,
and to the spirits of just men made perfect, verse 23.

But it may be objected,
that there is not a just man upon earth that doth good and sinneth not.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_
This was spoken before the coming of Christ, who came to destroy sin,
and finish transgression, as it is written, 1 John 3:8,
and to save his people from their sins, Matt. 1:21, not to be a Saviour in sin,
nor to save his people in their sins, but to save them from their sins,
and so from the punishment due thereunto.

[.discourse-part]
_Objection:_
But some in their blind ignorance will say, What benefit hath man by Christ,
if he come to live without sin?

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ He hath the benefit of the coming of Christ, of his death,
and of his resurrection, and of his blood which was shed for the remission of sins,
as it is written, Matt. 26:28. And he only can call Christ his redeemer,
who is redeemed from all iniquity. Tit. 2:14.

[.discourse-part]
_Objection:_ Again it is said, in many things we offend all, etc.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ This was spoken to the brethren as a warning, not to go into the many things,
nor to be many masters; for then they should receive greater condemnation:
for in many things they offend all,
and so did Martha while she was cumbered about many things, as Christ told her, Luke 10:41.
So when they went into the many things and many masters,
as the world doth now, they offended all;
but as they dwelt in the one thing which Christ spoke of, Luke 10:42,
they were kept out of the offences,
and kept a conscience void of offence towards God and all men. Acts 24:16.
1 Cor. 6:3. And Christ said, woe to the world because of offences:
for it must needs be that offences come; but woe unto that man by whom they come. Matt. 18:7.
Luke 17:1.

[.discourse-part]
_Objection:_ It is said also, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,
and the Truth is not in us.

[.discourse-part]
_Answer:_ This was spoken by John before he came to the fulness of Christ,
though he was come to a measure of the stature of Christ,
which kept him from committing sin; for he said, he that committeth sin is of the devil,
and hath not seen God, neither known him, 1 John 3:8.
And whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin,
for his seed remaineth in him; and he cannot sin, because he is born of God, 1 John 3:9.

John afterwards grew up to a perfect state, and said, Herein is our love made perfect,
that we may have boldness in the day of judgment; because as he is,
so are we in this world, 1 John 4:17. After this he said,
Whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ, hath not God;
but he that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, hath both the Father and the Son, 2 John 1:9.

And if any come unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house,
neither bid him good speed: for he that biddeth him good speed,
is partaker of his evil deeds, verses 10-11.

Hear this Leonard Letchford, and all other of thy belief!
John did witness a further state than committing of sin, or having it; but said,
whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of Christ,
is not to be received into the house, lest they were partaker of his evil deeds.
Will not this doctrine shut thee and all thy brethren out of doors,
who are not in the doctrine of Christ, but pleading with all your might against it,
which is perfection, and keeping his commandments, as I have before shown?
This was his doctrine while he was on earth, which you are now so much opposers of,
and pleading for committing sin for term of life.

I shall not trouble the reader to reckon up the commandments and laws of Christ,
they are so generally known to all who do but read the Scriptures.

But I shall further lift up a standard of righteousness against this generation,
who daily break the commands of God, and would persuade others so to do,
as Leonard Letchford hath done;
I shall here demonstrate how this strikes at the crown and dignity of Christ;
and then I shall leave it to the serious consideration of the honest-hearted,
whether this be a friend to Christ or an enemy to him.

1+++.+++ To say the things commanded by Christ cannot be done;
renders him unjust to command his servants to do that which he knows they cannot do.

[.numbered]
2+++.+++ This frustrates the end for which God manifested him,
which was to give power to as many as received him to become the sons of God.

[.numbered]
3+++.+++ This makes his commands of none effect; for if the things he commands cannot be done,
to what end were they given forth?

[.numbered]
4+++.+++ This doctrine renders him more unjust than the devil;
for he giveth the power to his servants to do all
manner of iniquity which he commands them,
and they obey his commands daily.

[.numbered]
5+++.+++ This is the highest dishonour that the enemies of Christ can bring to his sovereignty.

[.numbered]
6+++.+++ This makes the second covenant inferior to the first,
which is damnable doctrine and heresy.

[.numbered]
7+++.+++ This makes him an insufficient Saviour, who was called Jesus,
because he saved his people from their sins,
which is the breach of God`'s law and commandments.

[.numbered]
8+++.+++ This makes the blood of the covenant of none effect,
which was shed to cleanse his people from all sin.

[.numbered]
9+++.+++ This renders him an hard master; (to say his commands cannot be done),
which none ever said of him, but the slothful servant who hid his talent in the earth.

[.numbered]
10+++.+++ To say his commands cannot be done, doth make him a liar,
who commanded his servants to take his yoke upon them,
for his yoke is easy and his burden light.

[.numbered]
11+++.+++ This is an inlet for all the workers of iniquity,
to encourage them to break the commands of Christ,
and to keep them in unbelief all their days.

[.numbered]
12+++.+++ This makes the apostle`'s testimony false; who saith, greater is he that is in us,
than he that is in the world: but this renders him inferior to the prince of the world,
if his commands cannot exactly be done without sinning;
for what is it that hinders any from keeping his commands, but the prince of this world,
by whose power all who break his law and commandments are led?

[.numbered]
13+++.+++ This makes John a liar, who said his commandments were not grievous but joyous.

[.numbered]
14+++.+++ To say the things commanded by Christ cannot be done without committing sin,
as Leonard Letchford would have others say,
doth overthrow the foundation principles of the book of common prayer,
which enjoineth every child to keep God`'s holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same all the days of his life?

[.numbered]
15+++.+++ This makes the godfathers and godmothers (as they are called) covenant-breakers;
whom Leonard Letchford and others of his profession have caused to promise
and vow that the child should keep God`'s holy will and commandments,
and walk in the same to his life`'s end.
