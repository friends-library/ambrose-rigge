== George Whitehead`'s Testimony concerning Ambrose Rigge.

We having for many years been acquainted,
(as he was my countryman and loving friend) we loved as brethren from the first,
after we received the love of the Truth--which he retained;
and being faithful to the Lord, according to his gift,
was made partaker of the gospel ministry and testimony, by the word of eternal life,
and faithfully labored therein with fervent zeal to promote truth and righteousness;
whereby the Lord made him instrumental in convincing and
converting many souls to Christ and his righteousness.
The Lord gave him not only to believe, and to declare his name and gospel truth,
but also patiently to suffer for the same.

Besides the persecutions he suffered in the commonwealth`'s days, by severe stripes, etc.,
his many years imprisonment in Horsham jail in Sussex,
after king Charles II. was restored to the crown,
doubtless was one of the greatest trials;
yet the Lord greatly supported and strengthened him,
and many other innocent sufferers in those days.

In the year 1672,
a concern greatly fell upon me to have the king moved for the release
of many faithful Friends and brethren who then had been long confined in prisons;
as I knew this our ancient friend and brother was,
and Thomas Taylor, William Dewsberry, and many others, throughout England and Wales;
many whereof were under sentence of premunire.

Our friend Thomas Moore, thereupon delivered a paper of mine to the king,
in behalf of the prisoners; and soon after that, I went with him to the king,
and he granted us liberty to come before him and his council,
the next council day in the same week.
Accordingly we were admitted, and appeared before the king and a full council,
where I had liberty fully to plead the innocent cause of our friends in the prisons,
and the reason of their not swearing allegiance to the king;
it being really matter of conscience to them not to swear at all in any case, etc.
The king answered, I will pardon them; that is,
discharge them from the penalties of the laws, and their estates from confiscation,
which had been forfeited by the judgment of premunire.

This was to be done by the king`'s letters patent under the great seal of England,
which I was constrained to follow and solicit,
through the several offices which such letters patent pass, before effected;
which took me up near six months time and labor to get thoroughly effected and executed,
so as to release Friends out of prison, and re-convey their estates forfeited.

However, I was truly glad and thankful to God when it was obtained and done.
And so was this my dear friend and brother Ambrose Rigge,
with many more faithful friends and brethren, who had long deeply suffered.
I remember he would often mention the same to me with grateful acknowledgement of
my kindness and industry to obtain that liberty for him and many others,
being above 480 in all, released out of prisons.
He was of a loving and grateful spirit and temper,
and not apt to forget acts of kindness;
knowing how comfortable true love and brotherly kindness are,
and how happy and pleasant a thing it is for brethren to live therein.

He loved unity, peace and concord, and hated strife, divisions and discord,
and was zealous against the sowers thereof.
He truly loved his ancient brethren who kept their dominion in the Truth;
and as he loved union,
peace and concord in the churches of Christ and
labored for the promotion and increase thereof,
we had sweet society therein, even in true brotherly love and kindness,
blessed be the Lord our God,
for his great kindness and love in his dear Son
to us. And as therein we have been sufferers,
and spiritual warriors for his name and truth in his church militant here on earth,
I firmly believe and hope that we shall rejoice and triumph together in Christ,
with his church triumphant in his heavenly kingdom and glory forever.

I was at the funeral of our ancient friend and brother Ambrose Rigge at Reigate,
which was accompanied with a great concourse, and with solemnity,
in which the Lord`'s presence and power did attend us, and bless our assembly.

For he was a man that had obtained a good report,
and left a sweet savor of truth and honesty behind him.
