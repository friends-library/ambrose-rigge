[#benefits, short="The Benefits of True Christianity"]
== A Further Account of the Benefits of True Christianity, by the Spiritual Appearance of Christ.

The primary and fundamental principle of true Christianity, is the gift of God,
through which he will open the fountain of eternal life
to all the sons and daughters of men,
who will hear and receive him.
This gift is Christ in us, the hope of glory:
the mystery which has been hid from ages and generations,
but is now manifested to us Gentiles, a covenant of light: Col. 1:26-27,
Isa. 42:6. He is now preparing many temples to dwell and walk in;
out of which he has and will cast all the buyers and
sellers of things relating to his Father`'s kingdom,
that they may be made houses of prayer, who before were dens of thieves,
and merchant-places of the souls of men; and bind the strong man, i.e. the devil,
and spoil his goods, which are all unrighteousness, sin and iniquity,
with which he has Allied many temples, where the money-changers and receivers are,
and have been: but now he is preparing, and will prepare and cleanse them,
that they may be fit for him to dwell and walk in, according to his promise:
2 Cor. 6:16.

And as in his outward appearance he went into the outward temple at Jerusalem,
and cast out all them who bought and sold,
and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, etc., Matt. 21:12-13;
even so now in his inward and spiritual appearance, he will sanctify his temples,
and make them houses of prayer.

When first we came to the knowledge of this gift, we were made witnesses of this work,
which no other man could do. He brought us to know and
witness the first principle of his doctrine,
which was, repentance from dead works, (mark) from, not in, dead works:
so that the ungodly man and woman began to forsake their ungodliness,
and the unrighteous, their thoughts, and to return unto the Lord our God,
who then had mercy upon us, and did abundantly pardon,
according to his promise by the mouth of his servant the prophet: Isaiah 4:7.

This is repentance unto salvation, not to be repented of, 2 Cor. 7:10,
being the fruit and effect of godly sorrow: but the sorrow of the world works death,
and not repentance from dead works;
whereby mankind are made capable to serve the living God,
and to attain to true faith towards him, which works up the soul into love to him,
and all his commandments, and the doctrine of baptisms, and the resurrection of the dead,
and eternal judgment.

The next great gift of God, is true and living faith in his Son,
to all them who truly receive him,
to whom he gives power to become his sons and daughters.
This faith purifies the heart.
Acts 15:9, and works righteousness in the soul by love,
and leads up into the new creation in Christ Jesus unto good works,
that we may live in them.
In Jesus Christ neither circumcision, nor uncircumcision, avails anything;
but this faith, which works by love: Gal. 5:6. Which faith is a mystery,
held in a pure conscience, void of offense towards God and men, and overcomes the world,
within and without: John 5:4. Without which it is impossible to please God:
Heb. 11:6.

Till men and women come to receive this faith, which stands in the power of Christ,
and of his resurrection, their preaching is vain, and their faith vain,
and they are still in their sins.

This faith was once delivered to the saints,
by which they were made more than conquerors, through him who loved them: Jude 3,
Rom. 8:37.

This faith, in those who receive it, brings forth works of righteousness, i.e. love,
peace, joy, meekness, patience, temperance, obedience, faithfulness.
Love to God, and our neighbor; yes, love to enemies, brotherly-kindness,
and all the spiritual and temporal fruits of righteousness,
which it once brought forth in the saints and gospel believers, to whom it was delivered.

And we say, with the apostle James in his day, as the body without the spirit is dead,
so faith without these works is dead: James 2:17, to the end.
The same faith, through Christ`'s spiritual appearance in our day,
is now restored to the saints, and true gospel believers;
by which we stand witnesses against all false and dead faiths,
which bring not forth the fruits and works of righteousness, nor work by love,
nor give victory over the world; but leave the soul in death and darkness;
and the fruits there brought forth, are unholiness, intemperance, strife, debate,
contention, theft, murder, adultery, bloodshed, and all uncleanness and ungodliness,
which has made the world as a wilderness, full of briars and thorns, and beasts of prey.

Another great benefit, which springs from the fundamental principle of Christianity,
i.e. the gift of God, is the true and spiritual knowledge of the doctrine of baptisms,
etc.

First, the preparing baptism, being that of true repentance,
which John preached in the wilderness, to gather the Jews out of it,
and to open and prepare the Lord`'s way.
But his outward baptism, as it was with a decaying element and temporary,
it was to decrease, as the minister of it testified:
John 3:30. And it gradually decreased, according as the great apostle testified,
and thanked God he had used but little of that baptism, 1 Cor. 1:14-17,
being not thereunto sent, but to preach the gospel.

But the sprinkling children`'s faces with water,
and signing them with the sign of the cross in their foreheads,
waving John`'s baptism to adult persons, or believers, is a human tradition,
and has not the least footing in holy writ.
And this is our belief and doctrine, as to the elementary baptism.

But the saving baptism is that of Christ, with the Holy Ghost and fire:
this baptism sanctifies and purifies the heart, washing the inside;
whereby men and women are made indeed members of Christ, yes, clean members of his body,
children of God, and heirs of eternal life; being thereby joined to the Lord,
and made one spirit: 1 Cor. 6:17. Here is the new creature witnessed,
upon which the apostle laid the weight of the whole matter, Gal. 6:15,
and upon which the profit and spiritual advantage and benefit of both baptisms,
in their respective season, are known; though the first decreased,
the latter is increasing, to the end of days.
Whereby a daily death unto sin is witnessed, and a new birth unto righteousness obtained,
by all true and spiritual Christians; being baptized by one spirit into one body,
of which Christ alone is the head: 1 Cor. 12:13.

This baptism restores Christianity into its pristine glory and beauty,
which is holiness and righteousness, without which none shall see God,
to their eternal comfort: Heb. 12:14.

The baptizer with this baptism, has his fan in his hand, which John,
the elementary baptizer, had not; and will thoroughly purge his floor,
and gather his wheat into his garner; which John could not,
and therefore was not to continue, by reason of death.
So much in short for the doctrine of baptism, which has been taught us by Christ,
now in his spiritual appearance in our day.

Another great benefit and advantage we have received by the coming of Christ in spirit,
is true faith of the resurrection of the dead, under its several considerations:
the first and greatest, is Christ, who is the resurrection and the life:
John 11:25. Him has God raised to be Lord both of the living and the dead,
Rom. 14:9,
to be King and law-giver in the hearts and consciences of all his sons and daughters,
in all spiritual things, relating to the kingdom of his Father.
All judgment is committed unto him,
that he may give eternal life to as many as obey and follow him, who have a part in him,
by being washed from their sins and pollutions by him;
over such the second death has no dominion or power.
These are they who follow the Lamb in the regeneration,
whose garments are washed in his blood, being baptized into the likeness of his death,
and thereby made partakers of the power of his resurrection.

These being raised by his power out of the grave of sin and pollution,
which defiled all mankind in the first Adam; such are risen with him,
and seek those things which are above; as the apostles exhorted the Christians,
to set their affections on things that are above, and not on things that are below:
Col. 3:1-2. These have part in the first resurrection.
Rev. 20:6, and are priests of God and of Christ,
and shall reign with him forever and ever.

Concerning the resurrection of the dead:
seeing we believe that Jesus died and rose again; we also sincerely believe,
that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.
They shall come forth that have done good, unto the resurrection of life;
but they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of condemnation: John 5:29,
And as to the resurrection of bodies; God gives a body as it pleases him,
and to every seed his own body.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual: Howbeit that was not first,
which is spiritual, but that which is natural, and afterwards that which is spiritual;
see the holy apostle`'s explication in this case more at large: 1 Cor. 15.
And as the seed, or generation of the righteous,
who are born of the incorruptible seed, which is the word of God,
shall come forth in their glorious body, like unto Christ`'s; Phil. 3:21,
so the tares, the seed or generation of the wicked one,
shall contrary-wise come forth in their own proper bodies,
to receive their just judgment and condemnation:
for the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment, to be punished: 2 Pet. 2:9.

These things we sincerely believe, and in measure understand, by the Spirit of Christ,
our high priest and minister, being spiritually manifested in our mortal flesh,
to destroy the works of the devil, and to finish transgression,
and bring in everlasting righteousness; and so reconcile all mankind to God again,
who are enemies to him, by wicked works.

Another great benefit and advantage we have reaped and received,
by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in Spirit, in order to a future glory,
is the true and saving knowledge of the table of the Lord;
where we are made partakers daily of the nourishing
virtue of the body and blood of Christ,
as we daily dwell in him, and he in us. He testified to the Jews,
to put an end to the many scruples which they had concerning his flesh and blood,
i.e. He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, dwells in me, and I in him:
as the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eats me,
even he shall live by me: John 6:56-57.

This they could not understand, but strove among themselves, saying,
how can this man give us his flesh to eat? Having only an eye to his visible flesh: then,
to draw them off from that, he said, It is the Spirit that quickens,
the flesh profits nothing; the words I speak unto you, they are spirit and life,
verse 63.

This is beyond all the Jewish passovers, eatings and drinkings, types and shadows,
which he put an end to, by the offering of himself,
he being the anti-type and substance of them all: and his flesh and blood,
spiritually eaten and drunk by them who dwell in him, and he in them,
is life eternal to all such.
But to give carnal and worldly-minded men and women bread and wine before dinner,
whose eyes are not opened to discern the Lord`'s body, and call this a supper,
or sacrament, has not the least precept or example in the Holy Scriptures.

This we have learned in the deep,
whose faces the Lord has turned to the Sun of righteousness;
we cannot turn back to follow shadows, the spiritual manna being our bread and life;
and from our spiritual rock proceeds our water of life,
by which we are daily nourished up to eternal life,
that we may hunger and thirst no more; having living bread in our own houses,
and a well of living water, springing up to eternal life: John 4:14, and 6:50, 51.
This, in short, I was willing to testify to this particular also.

All other weighty principles of the doctrine of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,
which he preached in the days of his flesh, and are expressed in the Holy Scriptures, we,
by virtue of his coming in Spirit, have embraced, owned,
and freely received and vindicated, through many tribulations;
of which I have had not the least share; in and through which,
a divine hand has upheld me to grey hairs--and hope so to continue to the end of my days:
that so God over all, through his dear Son Jesus I Christ, our alone Savior, Mediator,
and Redeemer may be glorified; by whose power alone I have been preserved,
to whom I give the praise, both now, and hope I shall forevermore.

Postscript.--Forasmuch as many brethren have taken in hand,
to set forth and declare in word and writing,
of the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in spirit,
and of his glorious day and wonderful works, which he has wrought in many hearts,
since the working of Satan, with all unrighteous deception,
in the past long night of darkness and apostasy from the
purity and glory of the true and ancient Christian faith,
doctrine and principles, and have asserted, and to this day vindicated them,
against all opposition, which has not been little, nor from small or few hands: I also,
having been early an eye and ear witness of those things, which have been testified of,
in and by the mouths of many living witnesses; and well knowing,
through long and large experience, all those ancient doctrines, which my brethren,
in scorn called Quakers, have vindicated, to be true, sound, orthodox, and fundamental;
I could not be clear, before I leave this world,
but leave this short testimony in writing,
which I have often and many years declared in word; which all opposition,
both from the world and false brethren, could not overthrow;
in which by the assistance of the Almighty, I hope to continue,
to the finishing of my testimony.
Amen.
Hallelujah says my soul.
