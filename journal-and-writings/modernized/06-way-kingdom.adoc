[#way_to_kingdom, short="The Way to the Kingdom of God"]
== The Way Which Leads to the Kingdom of God, Held Forth to All Who Are Willing to Enter Therein.

As satan by sin and transgression opened a way
into eternal misery and condemnation from God,
for all who follow and obey him;
so God in his infinite love and mercy by Jesus Christ
has opened a gate of mercy unto all mankind,
and has prepared a way of life, peace, and eternal salvation,
that all who are willing to walk in it, may attain thereunto.

This way is called the Highway of holiness, which the unclean shall not pass over;
but the wayfaring man, though a fool, shall not err therein, Isa. 35:8,
This way is a mystery to all the sons of Adam, and is strait and narrow,
and few there be that find it, Matt. 7:14;
but the way which leads to destruction is wide and broad; and all the unclean, yes,
all the workers of iniquity can walk therein,
Matt. 7:13. There are but these two ways for all mankind to walk in;
the one leads to life eternal, and the other to eternal death.

Now the Lord has opened my heart a little to show unto every one the way of life,
which is Christ Jesus; John 14:6, and that by which they may be brought into this way,
according as the Spirit of God shall give me utterance.

It is written in the Scriptures of truth, that a woman having ten pieces of silver,
if she lose one, does light a candle, and sweeps her house,
and seek diligently till she find it; and when she has found it,
she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, Rejoice with me,
for I have found the piece which I had lost, Luke 15:8-9,
This is a parable of the way of life,
which is to be found within when the candle is lighted; and your house swept,
which is your heart, which is foul and corrupted by the enemy of your soul,
who has led you from mountain to hill,
like a lost sheep,--I mean from one high priest to another,
so that you have forgotten your resting place.
Therefore has the good Shepherd left the ninety and nine in the wilderness,
and is gone after you who are lost in the mountains, and will lay you upon his shoulders,
bring you home, and rejoice over you, Luke 15:4-5, And when you are come in,
you shall be fed in a good pasture by the rivers of water, where you shall not lack,
Ezek. 34:14, and your soul shall delight itself in fatness and shall live,
Isa. 55:2. For the Lord will be your Shepherd,
and you shall be established in righteousness, and great shall be your peace,
Isa. 54:13, and you shall not need to say.
Who shall ascend into heaven to fetch Christ from above? or who shall descend into
the deep to fetch him from beneath? but the word shall be nigh you,
in your heart and in your mouth, according as it is said, Rom. 10:8;
Duet. 30:14. This will be a lamp to your feet, and a light to your path,
Ps. 119:105, to guide you in the way of truth and peace, asdlfkjlksdfj
and will give you the light of the knowledge of
the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ,
2 Cor. 4:6.

So let every one search his own heart, and light the candle there,
that he may find the Word of faith there to guide him.
This word David hid in his heart, that he might not sin against God,
Ps. 119:11. This is the word of faith which I preach unto you,
that you may come to hear and receive it, whereby faith may be wrought in your heart,
to give you victory over the world, sin, depth, darkness, and the grave,
which have long separated you from God.
Then shall you witness him to be your Redeemer, even the Holy One of Israel,
But if you ask me what must lead you to this Redeemer? I answer.
The law of God which he has written in your heart,
according to his promise in the second covenant, Jer. 31:31-33.,
which law was the apostles`' schoolmaster to bring them to Christ,
that they might be justified by faith.
Gal. 3:24. This law will be your schoolmaster to bring you to Christ,
that you may be justified by faith, and not by the works of the law.
This will be a present teacher with you at all times and in all places,
and will never let you do evil,
nor do that to another you would not that he should do unto you.
It will bring you to love the Lord with all your heart, and your neighbor as yourself,
as it is written in the law of Moses; yes,
when you turn to the right hand or to the left, you shall hear a voice behind you,
saying, This is the way, walk in it, Isa. 30:21. But you may object and say.
Shall I not go to hear sermons from learned men,
such as are brought up at Oxford or Cambridge? I say, cease from man,
even from all those who keep you from the law written in your heart,
for such have no light in them, Isa. 8:20. Such are blind guides,
and would keep you from this law which is light, Prov. 6:23,
lest it should discover their darkness unto you,
and that they may lead you in blindness and darkness which lead to the chambers of death,
Prov. 7:27. You may spend all your substance upon the physicians,
as the woman had done, and yet was not cured, till she came to Christ, Luke 8:43-44;
and you will not be till you come to be led to him,
by that which manifests both your deeds of darkness and theirs also,
who have applied salve to your wounded soul,
before they have cleansed out your corrupted ulcers with which your soul has been loaded;
so their salve has taken no impression, nor been available at all unto you;
and they have been physicians of no value.
Job 33:4, but your corruptions have prevailed upon you till all your money is spent.
Oh, therefore hearken unto him who stands at your door and often knocks.

If you will open your door, he will come into you, and will sup with you,
and you shall sup with him.
Rev. 3:20. Then shall you know the supper of the Lord,
even a feast of unleavened bread.

If you will receive him,
he will cleanse your sores and lance your wounds like the good Physician,
and reach the living sensible part in you, that the corruption has not prevailed against;
and nothing else he will allow to remain within, that he may thoroughly cure you,
and make you perfectly whole in body, soul and spirit;
and then he will pour in the oil of joy for the spirit of heaviness,
that you may be called a tree of righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
Isa. 61:3. Then shall the light of the moon be as the light of the sun;
and the light of the sun shall be seven-fold, as the light of seven days,
in the day when the Lord binds up your breach and heals the stroke of your wound,
Isa. 33:26. Then shall you, who have been deaf, hear,
and your blind eye shall be opened, and shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness,
Isa. 29:18, and you shall increase your joy in the Lord,
and rejoice in the Holy One of Israel,
verse 19. Then shall judgment dwell in the wilderness, which you shall love,
and righteousness in the fruitful field in which you shall dwell,
and the work of righteousness shall be peace, and the effect of righteousness,
quietness and assurance forever, Isa. 32:16-17.

Then shall your soul delight itself in the Lord its Redeemer,
and magnify the name of the God of Israel all your days.
And you shall not need to be taught of your neighbor or of your brother to know the Lord,
for you shall know him, and be taught of him, and great shall be your peace,
according to the words of Jeremiah, Jer. 31:34; Isa. 54:13; John 6:45;
and the anointing wherewith he has anointed you shall abide in you,
and you shall not need any man to teach you,
but as the anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth and is no lie,
and even as it teaches you, you shall abide in him,
1 John 2:27. These things I have written to you concerning
any that would seduce you from this inward teacher,
verse 26; that if any come to your house and bring not this doctrine,
bid him not God speed, lest you be partaker of his evil deeds; yes, if I,
or an angel from heaven preach any other doctrine, let us be accursed,
and let God give no more increase to our work,
than he has done to the work of the priests these many years.

Therefore cease from man whose breath is in his nostrils,
and hearken unto him by whom God speaks in these last days, as you may read,
Heb. 1:1, who says, Learn of me and you shall find rest for your souls,
Matt. 11:29. He will be a sufficient teacher
unto you in all the ways of righteousness,
and be a wall unto you in the time of storm, and a shadow in the time of heat,
Isa. 25:4, yes, he will be your Shepherd,
and spread your table in the sight of your enemies, Ps. 23:1-5,
and he will lead you into green pastures by the rivers of water,
and will restore your soul to praise and glorify his name forever.
