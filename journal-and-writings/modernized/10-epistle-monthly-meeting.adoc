[#epistle_monthly, short="Epistle from Our Monthly Meeting"]
== An Epistle from our monthly meeting, held at our public meeting-house in Reigate, in Surrey, the seventh-day of the ninth month, 1692.

We being assembled with one accord in the unity of the spirit of Truth,
have a deep and weighty consideration upon our hearts and spirits,
of the important affairs of the church which the Lord has gathered in these parts,
out of the ways and works of darkness, to be a people to his praise,
and to walk as children of the day, in all godly conduct, and holiness.
He who has called us is holy, and he has made us livingly sensible,
that without holiness of life and conduct none
can be true members of the church of Christ,
neither are any the sons and daughters of God,
but as they are led and guided by the Spirit of God.

All who have continued and walked in him,
have been preserved out of the pollutions of the world,
and are as lights among their neighbors, showing forth before them their good works,
of a godly peaceable and quiet life, to the praise and glory of our Heavenly Father;
for the Truth as it is in Jesus, our holy head, leader and governor,
is the life of righteousness, and frees all who receive it, from all unrighteousness.
sdfsdfsdf
In this are the children of God in our day manifested from the children of Belial,
for whosoever does not righteousness is not of God,
neither he who loves not his brother and neighbor; but he who walks uprightly,
walks surely, and there is no occasion of stumbling in him.

And now dearly beloved Friends, whom the Lord has quickened,
and raised up out of the grave of sin and corruption, to be monuments of his mercy,
walk in the light of the Lamb;
so will the salvation of God be as walls and bulwarks round about you,
to preserve you from the fear of evil.
Stand you as witnesses for God in your day, against all ungodliness and worldly lusts,
both amongst' yourselves and the world.
Be you circumspect and watchful, over yourselves and your children,
and indulge them not in anything that is evil, but timely reprove and restrain it,
lest it become your sin;
and command them to observe the law of God written in their hearts;
for if you love the Truth as you ought yourselves,
you will train up your children in it when they are young.

Keep them to the plain and sound language,
which the Truth required and led all the faithful into in the beginning;
and keep them in plain and modest apparel and behavior,
in due subjection to the Truth in all things, in a holy conduct as much as in you lies,
that they may grow up in the grace of God as plants of his renown.
This is your duty, the Lord requires it of you, even to watch over your children,
as those that must give an account to God, while they are under your wings.
Eli's not restraining his sons became his sin, because he restrained them not,
and brought a curse upon his house forever, 1 Sam. 3:13-14.

Therefore beware of winking at or neglecting your children's sins,
while under your tuition; but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,
lest they bring shame upon your houses, and a reproach upon your posterity,
as some have already done, by departing from the counsel of God,
and the word of his grace,
which would have kept them in the hour of
temptation from the allurements of the evil one,
and so have made themselves a scorn to fools,
and a derision to them that are round about, and opened the mouths of evil men,
to blaspheme the name of the Lord and his holy tabernacle.
Better had it been for such not to have known the way of Truth,
than thus to turn from the holy commandment,
which is the lamp of righteousness to guide our feet in the way of peace.

And all young men and maidens, unto whom God has given the knowledge of his saving Truth,
be you sober and watchful,
for many and strong are the assaults of the enemy to overcome you,
and to bring you back again into Egypt's bondage.
Stand steadfast in Him who has called you, being girded with the Truth,
that you may be able to encounter the enemy of your souls,
which way soever he appearSj having upon your heads the helmet of salvation,
and the breastplate of righteousness, and shield of faith and sound judgment,
and the spiritual sword girded about your loins.
In this armor if you keep, the enemy cannot touch you.

The saving Truth which God has made known in our day, redeems all who love and obey it,
from all evil whatsoever, and out of the gall of bitterness and bond of iniquity,
and sets free from every evil deed, word and work, and discovers sin in the seed,
bud and root thereof, and gives power to slay it there,
before it breaks forth into action.
For as it is inward and spiritual,
it gives an inward and spiritual sight of the man of sin in
all his wiles and temptations in the conception thereof,
and arms all who believe in it against the enemy's power: being greater than the enemy,
it is able to subdue his power in all mankind,
and redeem them from their vain manner of life, making them capable to serve,
worship and obey the living God,
which none can do while they are in the evil deeds of the world.
And neither pride, covetousness, drunkenness, gluttony, theft, murder, adultery,
idolatry, hypocrisy, nor any ungodliness whatsoever,
can have any power or prevalence over them who keep the word of faith,
which is nigh in their hearts.
Such are clothed with the armor of light,
and they are able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy of their souls,
and through faith in the Son of God receive victory over death, hell and the grave.

These are plants of righteousness in our day,
and are daily watered and pruned by the Father's right hand,
and grow up as trees of righteousness, the planting of the Lord,
bringing forth fruits in due season to the praise of his name,
who has called them out of darkness into his marvelous light.

And now I exhort you brethren and friends, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
that you withdraw yourselves from every brother and sister who walks disorderly,
and have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness,
but rather in the authority of God's power and spirit reprove them.
If any that is called a Friend or a brother, be covetous, or an idolater, or a railer,
or a drunkard, or an extortioner, with such a one not to eat;
and if any obey not this gospel precept, note that person,
and have no fellowship with him or her, that they may be ashamed.
And if any have fellowship or society with such before they repent, after Friends,
in God's power and wisdom,
have given a testimony against them they are to be reproved and testified against,
as out of the order of the gospel and practice of the holy men of God in former ages.
For we cannot expect to stand clear as a people before our enemies,
till we have faithfully endeavored that all our meetings arid
camp may be cleansed of all ungodliness whatsoever.
For God is pure and holy, and will have a people so,
and no unclean thing or person can stand in his court or presence;
and in this his glorious gospel day of life, light and glory,
the most spiritual ministration,
and the last and greatest that ever the world shall be visited withal,
which in tender mercy and loving kindness he has caused to dawn in us,
he will be glorified in, by and through us, or without us, and against us;
for his name he will exalt in righteousness over nations,
and he will overturn and overturn, till he come to rule, whose right it is,
in the hearts and consciences of the sons of men.

And dear friends, have a care of the love of the world, and the riches thereof;
do not choke the good seed of the kingdom of righteousness sown in you,
for the enemy lies near many in that respect, their care,
labor and industry being more for the meat that perishes,
than for that which nourishes to eternal life.

Many grow cold in their love, zeal,
and affection to those weighty duties which God requires of us,
in meeting often together to wait upon him, to feel the operation of his divine power,
and his comfortable presence which has often
opened life and the treasures of it to our souls.

And as we have waited upon the Lord, we have renewed our strength,
and in meeting often together we have felt the Lord's presence in the midst of us,
so that we have not sought his face in vain;
all holy praises be returned to him for evermore.

And now beloved friends and brethren,
as the Lord in tender mercy has called us out of darkness,
to be children of his gospel day, let us not sleep as do others,
but with girded loins watcli and be sober,
casting off all the unfruitful works of darkness, and put on the armor of licfht,
that we may be valiant soldiers in the army of the Lamb,
and be able to quench all the fiery darts of the enemy.
For of a truth, the Lord is arisen to search his Jerusalem with candles,
and he will assuredly find out the hypocrite and the unclean,
and him who saved the wedge of gold, and the Babylonish garment,
though never so closely hid in his tent;
for all things are naked and bare to his all-seeing eye.

Woe to him who is covered, and not with the Spirit of the Lord,
for he will be left naked to his own shame to the view of all beholders.

And all young friends, both male and female, who have believed in the Truth,
and are coming up in the world, beware of a wanton loose spirit,
for it will lay you open to many snares and temptations,
whereby you will be betrayed by the enemy of your souls into many noisome lusts,
which will drown you in perdition, if you give way thereto.
First seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness,
by walking in the Truth that you have believed in,
and then all other things needful for you will be given you of God,
and the blessing withal, which will make you rich,
and add no sorrow with it. Take heed of seeking lawful things by unlawful means,
for if you so obtain them, they will wither under your hands.
Make not haste to be rich in this world, nor to lay up great things for your children,
lest it prove their snare and your sorrow.
Some of us have been young, and now are grown old,
yet in all our days we never saw the righteous forsaken, nor his seed,
who have walked in the way thereof to the end, begging their bread.
The way to be happy and prosperous in this world and that which is to come,
is first to breathe after righteousness, and walk in its way,
though for it you drink a bitter cup from the hands of men.
If you are willing to drink this for a time,
the sweet cup of blessing and consolation will be given you of God,
who keeps the best wine till the last,
and he will crown your grey hairs with honor and immortality.
Let not out your affections after the foolish, vain,
and frivolous fashions and customs of this world, for they will wither as the grass,
and fade as the flower thereof God Almighty direct your way,
and keep you under the wing of his power,
in the pure religion which keeps unspotted of the world,
that the honorable name by which you are called, and in which you have been preserved,
as you have trusted in it, may be your rock, refuge, and tower to the end of your days;
Amen.
