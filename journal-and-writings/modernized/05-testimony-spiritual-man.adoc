[.style-blurb, short="A Testimony Concerning the Spiritual Man"]
== A Testimony Concerning the spiritual man, who is begotten of God, through the Spirit, by the immortal word of God, which lives and abide forever, and has received, the Spirit of adoption, whereby he cries Abba Father.

As there is a natural man who is corrupted after the deceitful lusts,
so there is a spiritual man, who is born of the Spirit,
and has the promise of eternal life.
Through the adoption, that is, the redemption of the body,
he is made a habitation of God through the Spirit; in whom God dwells and walks,
according to his promise of old, 2 Cor. 6:16. He walks in the Spirit,
and does not fulfill the lusts of the flesh.

In him has God great delight, and gives him wisdom, power, strength,
and ability to do whatsoever he commands him,
and he can do all things through him who is his strength,
Phil. 4:13. The commandments of God are not grievous, but joyous to him;
no they are his only delight, and this keeps him in love and favor with God;
so that he withholds no good thing from him, Ps. 84:11,
but gives him of the abundance of his heavenly treasure.
He feeds him with the heritage of Jacob, even with the finest of the wheat,
and with honey out of the rock, Ps. 81:16,
he opens his breasts of consolation to him, out of which delightsome refreshment comes,
whereby he grows in the beauty of holiness.
In his mouth are the high praises of the Lord, as a two-edged sword in his hand,
through which he executes vengeance upon the heathen, and punishment upon the people,
Ps. 149:7. As the natural man is wise to do evil,
so the regenerated man is wise to resist evil,
so that it does not come nigh unto his house; yes, though evil pursue the wicked,
yet to him there is a tree of life, Prov. 13:21, upon which he feeds,
and lives forever.

He is stout and valorous, even as bold as a lion, Prov. 28:1;
he fears not the swelling of the sea, he is not afraid of the terror of the night,
nor of the arrow that flies by day, Ps. 91:5; the law of truth is in his mouth,
Mal. 2:6; so that his steps cannot slide.
He calls no man father upon earth, nor any man master below the sun, Matt. 23:10-9;
for he is born of God, and receives his law from his mouth;
he is created anew in Christ Jesus unto good works, that he may live in them.
He lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God, Matt. 4:4;
over him death or darkness has not power,
but he stands in the glorious liberty of the sons of God.
A free born son and heir of God, and a joint-heir with Christ Jesus, Rom. 8:17,
he grows up in the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ, unto a perfect man,
as it is written of him, Eph. 4:13, but this is a mystery to the natural man,
even as the wind blows where it wishes, and he hears the sound thereof;
but knows not from where it comes, nor where it goes, John 3:8,
even so is every one that is born of the Spirit.

Therefore they who are of the flesh, mind the things of the flesh,
and they who are of the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.
And as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God, Rom. 8:14,
but the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God,
for they are foolishness to him, 1 Cor. 2:14;
but the spiritual man judges all things, and he himself is judged of no man,
2 Cor. 2:15. This is that noble birth which
God has brought forth in many at this day,
unto whom we preach perfection and freedom from the law of sin and death,
which is the same wisdom which Paul said he preached among them that were perfect,
1 Cor. 2:6-7.

But this the carnal man cannot endure to hear of,
who receives not the things of the Spirit of God, as it is written of him,
1 Cor. 2:14. Therefore it is no marvel why
he cannot receive this doctrine of perfection,
which the holy men of God held forth unto the spiritual
man so plentifully throughout the Scriptures of Truth,
as I have showed before to all,
who with a spiritual eye discern the things of God by which they are only known,
1 Cor. 2:11, but they are foolishness and madness to the sons of Belial.

Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin, for his seed remains in him,
and he cannot sin, because he is born of God; then says he,
in this are the children of God manifested, and the children of the devil.
Whosoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother,
1 John 3:10-9. By this a man will soon see
whether he be a child of God or of the devil,
who would persuade others, that to do good and not to commit sin,
is that which none dares challenge upon the earth,
and that it would be praise to God to say his commandments
cannot be done without sinning or offending;
this cannot be paralleled in all the Scripture.

Therefore, oh! you begotten of God, who are born again of the water and of the Spirit,
give in your evidence against this unheard of heresy,
which God will confound with the breath of his mouth,
and with the brightness of his glory.
This is arisen and arising to expel all those fogs,
mists and vapors with which the man of sin has overspread the earth,
in this long night of darkness and apostasy from the life of God,
wherein the false church that has sat upon many waters has made all nations drunk,
Rev. 17:1-2; and 18:3, and has sat as queen, and seen no sorrow.

Her ministers have pampered themselves in the fulness of the earth,
and have made merchandize of many through covetousness and feigned words, 2 Pet. 2:3,
for these sixteen hundred years and upward,
ever since antichrist went out into the world,
who have continued in the world to this day, 1 John 2:18,
deceiving the nations with the multitude of their enchantments.
But now is the day of the Lord broken forth in clearness again in this latter age,
which has discovered her skirts with all her merchants,
who is worse than Balaam the son of Beor,
who though he loved the wages of unrighteousness, dared not take it. Num. 22:18;
24:13. But they love and take it, and persecute all those who will not give it to them,
as we have a cloud of witnesses standing upon record against them at this day.
