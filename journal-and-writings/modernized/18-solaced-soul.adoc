== The Song of A Solaced Soul

[verse]
____
Mount up, my soul, on contemplation`'s wing.
And sound high praises, to thy Heavenly King:
Who has destroyed death; that he may be
forevermore a Savior unto thee.
Therefore to live is Christ, to die is gain,
That thou with Him, forever may remain.
In perfect triumph, over death and hell.
In those sweet mansions, which no tongue can tell.
So while on earth thou do continue here.
Mind thy Redeemer, with continual fear;
Who will preserve thee, to your finishing day,
From sin to death, and every evil way,
Then will God`'s secrets ever thou attend,
And crown thy head with laurel in the end.
